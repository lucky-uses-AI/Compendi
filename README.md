# Compendi: The AI Design Operating System

**Compendi** is a prompt-based "Operating System" that turns your AI coding assistant (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) into a Senior UI Architect.

It provides a strict, token-driven framework for generating pixel-perfect interfaces, ensuring your AI doesn't just "guess" at design, but follows a rigorous system of Law and Structure.

## 🚀 Installation

1.  Download the .md file or copy the content of `compendi_v1.0.1.md`.
2.  Paste the file into your project's folder or the text in your AI's "Custom Instructions" as text.
3.  That's it. The Architect is now active.

## ⚡ The Protocols

Compendi comes with two built-in "programs" you can run by simply asking the AI:

### 📜 Protocol Apostle (The Scribe)
*Use this to clone existing websites.*
> "Initiate Protocol Apostle."

The AI will guide you through a transcription process:
1.  **Witnessing:** You provide a URL/Screenshot.
2.  **Extraction:** The AI extracts exact colors and fonts.
3.  **Translation:** The AI maps them to system tokens.
4.  **Revelation:** The AI generates an HTML preview for you to verify.
5.  **Inscription:** The AI saves the new style permanently to your library.

### 🔮 Protocol Messiah (The Creator)
*Use this to generate new styles from scratch.*
> "Initiate Protocol Messiah."

The AI will act as a Creative Director:
1.  **Prophecy:** You provide a vibe (e.g., "Cyberpunk gardening app").
2.  **Covenant:** The AI proposes 3 art directions.
3.  **Genesis:** The AI generates a complete design system (JSON tokens).
4.  **Revelation:** The AI generates an HTML preview.
5.  **Canonization:** The AI saves the new style permanently.

## 🎨 The Style Catalogue

Compendi includes a pre-built style to get you started:
*   **Style 01: Midnight Obsidian:** A polished, modern dark mode with glassmorphic accents.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Tokens:** JSON-based (Colors, Typography, Spacing, Motion).
*   **Icons:** Native support for **Heroicons** and **Lucide**.
*   **Output:** Generates CSS Variables, Tailwind Configs, or pure CSS.
